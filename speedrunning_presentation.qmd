# Why?

##
Many reasons:

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Engaging with a game you love in new terms
- Fun competition!
- Fun _cooperation_!
- Why not, really?
:::

## Speedrunning is empirical science

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Clearly measurable outcomes (did you go faster?)
- Lots of experimentation
- Theory-based approach
:::

# Can _anyone_ do it?

# Yes.
