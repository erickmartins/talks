# Personal intro

## Hello!

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- I am **very** excited to be here!
- Quick background:
    - Engineering undergrad 
    - Computational physics M.Sc. and Ph.D.
    - Working with microscopy data for the last (almost) 8 years
- Outside work: video games (especially speedrunning), hiking, swimming

## _Any_ data won't be enough. {.center}

## AI (the good part)
 - Requires a LOT of data: how to make a lot of data accessible?
 - Requires "good data" - what does that mean? Metadata, annotations provide context
 - the imaging case: NGFF challenge as blueprint

# Let's talk about AI (the ugly part)

## AI (the bad part)
 - Licensing situation is more and more complicated
 - Resource issues: crawlers, bots, and so on

## The bad part has no clear solution and will be an evolving picture for the near future

## The good part is solved on the technical side; the challenge is societal/lowercase-p political
